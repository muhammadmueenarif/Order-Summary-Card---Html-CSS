we wil try to build an order summary component just like something we order and a final summary page 
shows to us to tell what are we buying and what is price etc., 
we can use website frontend mentor and start project and monitor progress. 

Figma and sketch are commonly used tools to see designs that designer give. you can check figma 
ui design tutorial on free code camp. open figma design and click on the component, it will show 
exact details of that component. 
we will design it for desktop and once it is build you can redesign it for mobile and this can be done 
by using media queries.
