we wil try to build an order summary component just like something we order and a final summary page 
shows to us to tell what are we buying and what is price etc., 
we can use website frontend mentor and start project and monitor progress. 

Figma and sketch are commonly used tools to see designs that designer give. you can check figma 
ui design tutorial on free code camp. open figma design and click on the component, it will show 
exact details of that component. 
we will design it for desktop and once it is build you can redesign it for mobile and this can be done 
by using media queries. 

index.html is default page for our website if no other page is specified. ! and hit enter. it will write
default html code. 

search frontend mentor order summary card component on google and it will give code and starter also.

if you are using locally, you will need to hit enter refresh button each time you make changes. 
you can use live server extension in vs code to avoid refresh. 

what is html? what is css? css used for styling. 
connect css file with html file. 
using css selector. tag, class and id. 
in :root, we can set our global css variables. to create css variables, we use -- and variable name. 
    --dark-blue:hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
if we want to use it, then we wil use it in following way. e.g, if we want to give background to card,
.card {background-color:var(--dark-blue)}

we used curby background image in the background.
